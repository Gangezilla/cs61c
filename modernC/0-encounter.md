# Chapter 1: Getting Started

- C is an imperative programming language. Imperative meaning, it looks like English so it's easier to understand it.
- The compiler translates the C text into something our machine understands.
- A correct C program is portable between different platforms.
- Portable means that wherever you run a particular program, its behaviour should be the same.
- C is designed to give computers orders. Thereby it mediates between us and computers.
- C must be compiled to be executed. The compiler provides the translation between the language that we understand and the specific needs of the platform.
- C gives a level of abstraction that provides portability. One C program can be used on many different architectures.
- The C compiler is there to help you.
